Pre, Post or In is basically the position of root node in tree

Basic logic :
`inorder = [9,3,15,20,7], postorder = [9,15,7,20,3]`


last element of every postorder is the root element

and leftof that root element in inorder will give us left subtreee and right of that element will give us right subtree
