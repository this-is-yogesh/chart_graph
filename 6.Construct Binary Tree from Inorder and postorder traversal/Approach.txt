Pre, Post or In is basically the position of root node in tree

Basic logic :
`inorder = [9,3,15,20,7], postorder = [9,15,7,20,3]`


last element of every postorder is the root element

and leftof that root element in inorder will give us left subtreee and right of that element will give us right subtree

Approach:

keep a map to keep track of element in inorder with its index

pick the last element of postorder array, which will be root which is 3 here,

to construct left subtree - to track  start of leftsubtree will , instart variable initialize with 0, to keep track of end of leftsubtree , index of root in inorder - 1, inorder will be (0,0) = [9], we will also need a postorder to take root from that, postorder start index will be 0 initialize, and end will start + index of root in order -1=(0,0) =[9] 

to construct right subtree.- to track start of rightsubtree, right will be instart will be index of root in inorder + 1,inend will be length of inorder -1, inorder will be (2,4) = [15,20,7],we will also need a postorder to take root from that, postorder start index will be start + index of root in order, end will be posend -1 = (1,3) =[15,7,20]
