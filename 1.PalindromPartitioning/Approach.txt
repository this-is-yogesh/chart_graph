Base logic : Get a substring out and check if palindrome or not if yes then that is one part , store in sub array and , do recusrive call with increased index and present subarray , again cut substring and check, if size reached then base case so come back , do a pop up  to remove the part from subarray and repeat

Learning :

1. how recursion behaves inside for loop
2. Steps:
a. make a cut, get the stringpart out
b. check if string part is pal
c.if yes then push string part to part ans
d.recursive call with index plus 1 and present part ans
e.pop from part ans after recursive call
